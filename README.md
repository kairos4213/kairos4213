## Hi, I'm James
I am an aspiring software developer with a background in operations and a proven record of solving workflow challenges through automation. I love learning about and building with Go and Python. I first discovered my passion for programming by building a time-conversion system in Excel, which sparked a deeper interest in software development, automation, and process improvement.

I'm looking for a full time role, so if you know of anyone looking to hire an entry level role, please reach out!
